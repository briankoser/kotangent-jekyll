        Mr. Koser understands that American grammar calls for periods (or “full stops”) to be placed inside the ending quotation mark for sentences ending with a quoted phrase, even if that phrase did not originally contain a period or “full stop”. Mr. Koser agrees instead with British grammar that allows the period to be placed outside the ending quotation mark, which he states is “visually clearer and intrinsically more logical”.
