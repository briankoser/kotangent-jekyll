Here are all the interesting links that I found in September 2015 that I deem worthy of being preserved for the future.

<li>[We Don’t Sell Saddles Here](https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d)

<li>[Innovation in Mobile Browsers, and the iPhone](http://www.broken-links.com/2015/09/14/innovation-in-mobile-browsers-and-the-iphone/)

I read this and immediately uninstalled the Facebook app from my Android. Now that the website supports push notifications, I’m perfectly happy to use the website.

<li>[Our password hashing has no clothes](http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/06/our-password-hashing-has-no-clothes.html)
