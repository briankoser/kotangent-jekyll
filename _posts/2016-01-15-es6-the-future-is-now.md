Last month I gave a presentation at work about ES6 ([view the slides](http://slides.com/briankoser/deck)). Giving yourself two weeks to prepare a talk on a subject you don’t know is a great way to learn. :) But, I learn best when actually building something, so I converted [thomas](http://github.com/briankoser/thomas) to ES6. Now I’m missing the new features in my work projects, especially arrow functions and string interpolation. I’m not yet sure I’d want to add a transpilation step to production JS, but I’m definitely using it on as many future personal projects as possible.
