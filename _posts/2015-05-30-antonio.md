If you’re into designer board games (you should be!) and you’re online (…you are!), then you’re probably aware of [BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com), which is *the* board game website, where aficionados discuss, trade, and celebrate all things board gaming.

Recently, a fellow named Scott Jaworski [asked](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1369255/there-some-way-see-what-someone-who-wants-what-i-h) if there’s a way to find a list of board games he could get in a trade if he traded one of his away. <abbr>BGG</abbr> doesn’t support this functionality, and it sounded like an interesting and easy project, so I went ahead and did it. Meet [Antonio](http://koser.us/antonio). Here’s how he was formed:

Most of the necessary data is availalbe from the <abbr>BGG</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr>. Rather than using the official [<abbr>BGG</abbr> <abbr>XML</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr>](http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API2) directly, I decided to use [E. Strathmeyer’s JSON API](http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1139853/ajax-ready-bgg-api-any-web-programmers-out-there), which is built upon the former. I considered  [a different JSON API](http://bgg-json.azurewebsites.net/), but it was down when I started coding. Maybe next time.

One item not provided is the list of users that want to trade for a game. So, I wrote my own <abbr>API</abbr>. Having never written a web <abbr>API</abbr> service, I started researching technologies. The best option looked to be an [<abbr>ASP.NET</abbr> Web <abbr>API</abbr>](http://www.asp.net/web-api), so I read some of the Microsoft tutorials and got started. The <abbr>API</abbr> itself was surprisingly easy to set up, as was deploying to Azure. I used [HTMLAgilityPack](http://htmlagilitypack.codeplex.com/) and [Fizzler](https://code.google.com/p/fizzler/), which made screen scraping easier than expected. In fact, while I expected this to be the most difficult piece of the puzzle, it turned out to be one of the easiest.

I did get tripped up by <abbr>CORS</abbr>, cross-origin resource sharing. This had to be enabled so I could call my <abbr>API</abbr> from a web page. Once I identified the problem it was [not difficult to fix](http://www.asp.net/web-api/overview/security/enabling-cross-origin-requests-in-web-api).

Next I set up a simple web page, grabbed jQuery, and started writing the client-side portion of Antonio. This portion took the most time, and had some challenges of it’s own, a couple of which were solved by new-to-me features: the [apply](http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply) function and [promises](http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/).

One disappointment was that, while you can get the games a user wants to trade from <abbr>BGG</abbr>’s <abbr>API</abbr>, you can’t get it on demand. The data has to be generated, which in my experience takes up to 24 hours. My solution was to display a list of users whose data is being generated, but it’s annoying that a user could type a game into Antonio and then have to wait until the next day, come back to the page and search for the game again. Oh well.

[Antonio](http://koser.us/antonio) was a fun project to write, and I learned a good bit about <abbr>.NET</abbr> and JavaScript to boot. Check it out, and let me know if you have any questions about anything. You can see all the code at [Github](http://github.com/briankoser/antonio). If you experience problems, you can [contact me](http://briankoser.com/contact/), [open an issue](http://github.com/briankoser/antonio/issues/new) on the Github project, or reply to [my post about Antonio on <abbr>BGG</abbr>](http://boardgamegeek.com/article/19376164). ∎
