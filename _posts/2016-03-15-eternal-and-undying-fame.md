In 2005, [Peter-Paul Koch](http://www.quirksmode.org/about/) launched a small [JavaScript contest](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/09/addevent_recodi.html). The contestants re-implemented an addEvent() function originally written in 2001. As a prize, PPK offered “eternal and undying fame” and asserted, “your name could become a household name”. The [winner](http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2005/10/_and_the_winner_1.html)? John Resig, who the following year wrote jQuery ([the world’s most popular JavaScript library](http://libscore.com/#libs)) and went on to become the most well-known JavaScript developer in the world.
