I just watched an [Inversion of Control course](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/inversion-of-control) on Pluralsight. I get it now, but I’m writing this down to make sure I get it tomorrow.
 
- **Dependency Inversion Principle** - accessed items should not depend on accessor items

- **Inversion of Control**
    - a pattern to “solve” the Dependency Inversion Principle
    - accessor tells accessed how they will interact
    - *Interface inversion* - accessor creates interface rather than accessed
    - *Flow inversion* - event-driven instead of procedural programming
    - *Creation inversion* - object is created outside of the class it is used in
        - factory pattern (```Button button = ButtonFactory.CreateButton();```)
        - service locator (```Button button = ServiceLocator.Create(IButton.class);```)
        - dependency injection
 
- **Dependency Injection**
    - dependency is created outside of class that depends on it
    - differs from creation inversion because it specifies that the dependency is not created by the dependent; in e.g. the factory pattern, the dependent is still responsible for creating the dependent by calling the factory
   
    - *Constructor Injection*
        - most common
        - dependency is passed into constructor and stored as field in object
    - *Setter Injection*
        - dependency is passed into setter and stored as field in object
    - *Interface Injection*
        - class has interface which requires a setter
        - when calling cast the class as the interface and call the interface’s setter
        - more explicit than just a setter
       
- **IoC Container**
    - framework for doing dependency injection
    - resolves the chain of dependencies
 
They aren’t difficult concepts. Really, the most difficult part is keeping all the terminology straight.
