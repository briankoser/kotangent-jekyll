Last time I wrote about how much I like the beginning of a project. Opening up all the cans of tech and getting a big whiff of that new technology smell…*sniff* Aaaah. Well, I liked choosing the technologies for my new project so much, that I decided to do it again!

Ruby on Rails seems like a great framework. I had fun messing around with it, reading blogs, doing the tutorials. Great fun. But it’s June. Almost July. Four months later, and I’m still working through tutorials.

This isn’t really a Ruby on Rails issue so much as a technology-that-I-don’t-know issue and a I-don’t-have-copious-amounts-of-free-time-to-learn-this-technology issue. I do have a life beyond programming, and at this point, I just want to start building this website. So, new requirements:

1. Something I already know, or at least close, so I can actually get the project done
2. Something new (to me at least)

    Most importantly,

3. Something the cool kids are using

Yes, 1 and 2 are contradictory, thank you for pointing that out. Before you get too smug, let me say that I found what I was looking for.

Behold, ASP.NET MVC. Careful, don’t let the sheer power of all those capital letters overwhelm you. For me, ASP.NET MVC is sort of a compromise between learning something completely new, like Rails, and using something I already know, like ASP.NET Webforms.

So I’ll be using ASP.NET MVC with Azure. I’ll still probably use Ember as well. We’ll see how far I get this time before deciding to switch to node.js or meteor or…
