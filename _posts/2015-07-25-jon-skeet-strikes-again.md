Quick background on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [Jon Skeet](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet): Stack Overflow is a website where you can ask and answer computer programming-related questions. Everyone votes on the questions and answers, and you get points when someone votes for you. Jon Skeet has the most Stack Overflow points, which means he asks and answers a lot of questions, and he does it well. He’s become a celebrity on the site; you can think of him as the computer programmer’s Chuck Norris:

<blockquote>
	Jon Skeet can recite pi. Backwards.
</blockquote>

So I was on Stack Overflow looking up information on C# verbatim string literals when I came across [these answers](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/556133/whats-the-in-front-of-a-string-in-c):

I thought, *that’s rare to see Jon Skeet as the number two answer on a question, kudos to Richard Everett*. And then I clicked the link in Richard’s answer, and realized it linked to a book. An actual printed book. Authored by Jon Skeet.
