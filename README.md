kotangent-jekyll
================

I originally started writing my blog [Kotangent](briankoser.com/blog) with Wordpress because 
I just wanted to write without obsessing over *how* I was writing. Unfortunately, Wordpress
annoyed me with it's obtusity, with the back-breaking straw being PHP errors when I tried
to install a syntax highlighter plugin.

So this is my blog with Jekyll. Hopefully you'll enjoy it for the content and not give a
thought about how it was created.
